## Week 3 – Smart Contract Journey

Hello, welcome to Week 3 of my smart contract development journey. This week is focused on writing more secure and production-ready Solidity contracts by understanding how to handle errors, manage ETH safely, and build better user interactions through control flows.


## Day 1 – Error Handling in Solidity (require, revert, assert)

**What I Learned:**
- The role of `require` in validating inputs and access control.
- How `revert` can be used for custom errors and complex conditions.
- When to use `assert` to enforce internal logic and detect serious bugs.
- Proper error handling can prevent critical vulnerabilities and improve contract robustness.

**What I Built:**
- A simple wallet contract that allows deposits and withdrawals.
- Used `require` to ensure sufficient balance before withdrawals.
- Used `revert` to handle ETH transfer failures.
- Used `assert` to validate internal state and sanity checks.
- Included comments and structure for better readability and documentation.

Every contract in this repo is a step in my journey to mastering Solidity and smart contract development.
