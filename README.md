# Smart Contract Journey

Heyy, I'm Toyin! Welcome to my smart contract development journey.  
This repo tracks my week-by-week progress as I learn and build projects using Solidity and Web3 tools.

## Week 1
**Day 1** – [`HelloBlockchain.sol`](week1/Day1_HelloBlockchain.sol)  
A simple contract that stores and updates a message:  
“Hello, Blockchain. I'm coming for you”
