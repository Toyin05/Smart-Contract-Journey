# WEEK 1, DAY 2 - Counter Contract

This is a simple counter contract I built as part of my smart contract development journey.

It has:
- A `count` variable
- `increment()` to add 1
- `decrement()` to subtract 1

Just learning how to work with Solidity functions and state variables.

Built using Remix IDE.

Stay tuned for more as i learn
