# Week 1 – Smart Contract Journey
Welcome to Week 1 of my smart contract development journey. Here's a summary of what I learned and built each day.


## Day 1 – Counter Contract Basics
What I Learned:
- Data types like `uint`, `int`, `string`, `address`
- Writing simple functions
- Creating and updating a basic state variable
What I Built:
- A simple counter contract with `increment()` and `decrement()` functions.
File Name: `Day1_Counter.sol`


## Day 2 – Functions & State Logic
What I Learned:
- How functions work in Solidity
- Visibility types (public, private, internal, external)
- How state changes are recorded on the blockchain
What I Built:
- Expanded the counter contract with better formatting
- Understood function scope and gas implications
File Name: `Day2_CounterUpdated.sol`

---

## Day 3 – Validation & Access Control
What I Learned:
- Using `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` for validation
- Creating custom modifiers like `onlyOwner`
- Restricting function execution to the contract deployer
What I Built:
- An enhanced counter contract that’s safer and more realistic
File: Name: `Day3_CounterWithValidation.sol`



Every contract in this repo is a step in my journey to mastering Solidity and smart contract development
